\section{Introduction}

The PELEE Statistical Update is an upgraded version of the PELEE analysis where we add runs 4 and 5. In addition to the addition of more statistics, some improvements to the event selection, signal modelling and treatment of systematics have also been made that are documented here. 

\subsection{Goals of this analysis}
(Giuseppe)
\section{Event Selection}
focus on changes with respect to the previous selection
(Kate + Sophie)

\subsection{Selection validation}
Describe validation of run 4 and 5 selection

Technical verification of the framework (Chris)

Show consistency across runs
Compare variables across runs, data/MC plots 
For example, runs 123 compared to run 4 and 5 separately

Check things like consistency of calorimetry, rate of cosmics, inputs into the BDT
Fan's plots for run 4 and 5 validation (Fan)

\section{Sidebands}
Consistency checks in each sideband
0p and Np variation of two-shower sideband, inverted BDT sideband
Consistency at different selection stages:
preselection, loose selection, full selection
see Chapter 11(?) of the previous note

\section{Signal model}
Describe Fan's signal model (Fan)

\section{Systematics and expected sensitivity}
(outline by David)

\subsection{EXT smoothing}
(Alex)

\subsection{Constraints}
Describe briefly, refer to older analysis
Potentially think of new ideas here
\section{Unblinding strategy}
(Giuseppe)
